      "body": "Unlocking Location Value in Property Marketing\n\nProperty marketers don’t always have internal amenities that stand out as their strongest selling point. But what if we could “borrow” the strengths from the neighbourhood instead?\n\nConsider properties near Sunway Lagoon. Instead of just highlighting proximity, why not run a digital campaign offering a free theme park day pass for lead generation? For actual buyers, give a truly unique reward: a 5-year annual pass to Sunway Lagoon, which means up to 1,825 days of free family fun, making lifestyle and experience part of the value proposition.\n\nTo create urgency, this campaign would run for only 3 months. Why? Because effective marketing is about storytelling and stories need momentum and fresh twists to stay compelling. Extending a campaign indefinitely leads to audience fatigue, switching strategies every quarter keeps the message vibrant and prospects engaged.\n\nFor those marketing properties outside Sunway, this strategy is just a template. Audit your local area for interesting lifestyle spots whether it’s a theme park, retail hub, cultural centre, or nature retreat and craft an irresistible campaign that leverages those neighbourhood strengths.\n\nDon’t just sell units, sell gateways to experiences people desire.\n",

      "body": "In our field, we come across useful videos, ideas, and insights almost every day. \n\nMost people watch… nod… and move on. That’s where the opportunity dies. Whenever I find content that’s relevant to sales, marketing, consumer psychology, or team development, I treat it as raw material, something I can reshape into practical value. And with AI, this process has never been easier or faster.\n\nRecently, I watched a solid video[](https://lnkd.in/gT4K4Psz). Instead of just saving it, I fed it into AI along with my intentions. I’ve also included a screenshot of my exact prompt not because it’s perfect, but to show how simple the workflow can be.\n\nWithin minutes, AI turned that video into structured insights I can use for my team.\n\nThis isn’t about replacing thinking. It’s about training ourselves to think better and letting technology amplify that thinking.\n\nDon’t just consume content. Redevelop it. Adapt it. Extract value from it. The real skill today is knowing how to turn information into output quickly. We finally have tools that can multiply our capabilities. The ones who learn to use them will move faster, create more impact, and stay ahead.\n\nSharing the video link here, along with my prompt screenshot, in case it inspires you to try the same process.\n",
