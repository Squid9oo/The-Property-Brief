      <!-- 5 Differentiators -->
      <section style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
        <h2>What You Get — All Free</h2>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-bottom:1.75rem;">Five things The Property Brief gives you that no other Malaysian property platform offers at zero cost to you.</p>

        <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:1.25rem;">

          <div style="padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; border-left:3px solid var(--accent,#f5c800); background:rgba(255,255,255,0.04); border-radius:0 8px 8px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin:0 0 0.4rem; font-size:1rem;">1. Free Real Estate News Monitoring</h3>
            <p class="muted" style="margin:0;">Curated Malaysia and ASEAN property news, updated regularly. Media intelligence platforms charge subscription fees often tiered by user count and complexity. The Property Brief removes that paywall entirely. Every reader gets the same market intelligence, free.</p>
          </div>

          <div style="padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; border-left:3px solid var(--accent,#f5c800); background:rgba(255,255,255,0.04); border-radius:0 8px 8px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin:0 0 0.4rem; font-size:1rem;">2. Insider Developer Strategy — The Only Platform of Its Kind</h3>
            <p class="muted" style="margin:0;">Every strategy article is drawn from direct experience as a Sales &amp; Marketing practitioner at a publicly listed property developer in Malaysia. No other Malaysian property website offers this perspective. These are not borrowed theories — they are real playbooks from real campaigns, written in plain language and made accessible to everyone.</p>
          </div>

          <div style="padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; border-left:3px solid var(--accent,#f5c800); background:rgba(255,255,255,0.04); border-radius:0 8px 8px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin:0 0 0.4rem; font-size:1rem;">3. Free Project Listings</h3>
            <p class="muted" style="margin:0;">Developers, agents, and project owners can list their projects at zero cost. Every approved listing gets a dedicated page with full SEO and AI-search schema, making the project discoverable on Google and AI search engines. Listings auto-expire after 30 days to keep the feed fresh and relevant.</p>
          </div>

          <div style="padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; border-left:3px solid var(--accent,#f5c800); background:rgba(255,255,255,0.04); border-radius:0 8px 8px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin:0 0 0.4rem; font-size:1rem;">4. Property Finance Simulator — Not Just a Mortgage Calculator</h3>
            <p class="muted" style="margin:0;">Most online calculators only show the monthly instalment. The Property Brief's simulator shows the <em>full financial picture</em> of owning a property in Malaysia: true monthly commitment, upfront cash breakdown (down payment + legal fees + stamp duty), EPF withdrawal impact, Debt Service Ratio (DSR) from both the bank view and your real-life cashflow view, extra repayment simulation, and a printable PDF summary.</p>
          </div>

          <div style="padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; border-left:3px solid var(--accent,#f5c800); background:rgba(255,255,255,0.04); border-radius:0 8px 8px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin:0 0 0.4rem; font-size:1rem;">5. Transparent Advertising — First in Malaysia</h3>
            <p class="muted" style="margin:0;">Unlike other media platforms that hide their numbers behind polished PDFs, The Property Brief publishes its full traffic data live — visible on the advertising page to anyone. If you are a brand or developer looking to advertise, you see the real audience size and composition before you commit. No guesswork. No inflated claims.</p>
          </div>

        </div>

      <!-- Who Built This -->
      <section style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
        <h2>Who Built This</h2>
        <p class="muted">
        The Property Brief was built by someone who spent 25 years inside Malaysia's property industry including serving as Sales and Marketing General Manager at a publicly listed developer. The articles, tools, and platform design all come from that background.
        </p>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          That background matters. The strategy articles here are not borrowed from textbooks or aggregated from other websites. They come from inside actual developer boardrooms, launch campaigns, and sales floors — the thinking that normally stays behind closed doors, written in plain language for anyone to use.
        </p>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          The goal is simple: make the Malaysian property industry more accessible, transparent, and useful for first-time buyers, seasoned investors, agents, and developers alike.
        </p>

      <!-- Who This Is For -->
      <section style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
        <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-bottom:1rem;">If you are any of the following, The Property Brief is built for you:</p>
        <ul style="color:var(--muted,#aaa); line-height:2.1; padding-left:1.25rem;">
          <li><strong>First-time homebuyers</strong> — Use the finance simulator to understand what you can actually afford, including the hidden costs most calculators ignore.</li>
          <li><strong>Property investors</strong> — Track Malaysia and ASEAN market news, developer moves, and policy changes in one place, for free.</li>
          <li><strong>Real estate agents and negotiators</strong> — Get free listing exposure for your projects and sharpen your market knowledge with insider strategy articles.</li>
          <li><strong>Property developers</strong> — List projects at zero cost, reach an informed property audience, and advertise with full transparency on pricing and reach.</li>
          <li><strong>Industry professionals</strong> — Access the kind of developer marketing strategy that is normally locked inside corporate teams.</li>
        </ul>
