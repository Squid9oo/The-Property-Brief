### Tropicana’s Johor data-centre park draws ESG scrutiny

A Johor industrial project tied to an AI/data-centre build in Nusajaya 2 Industrial Park has come under pressure from nearby residents over dust and late-night construction activity linked to works by Tropicana Firstwide, a wholly owned unit of **Tropicana Corp Bhd**.  At a townhall, residents pushed the local council to tighten enforcement on working hours and dust control, while the developer committed to add more slope netting, introduce hydro-seeding and continue water bowser runs, and is studying requests for compensation.

### EPF signals steady property/infrastructure appetite via IJM

EPF’s portfolio still carries about 7% in property and infrastructure and the fund has lifted its stake in **IJM Corporation Bhd** to roughly 20.4%, making it IJM’s largest shareholder and reinforcing its preference for diversified built-environment exposure.
