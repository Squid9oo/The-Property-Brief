summary: "EPF's 6.15% dividend announcement dominated Saturday headlines, but
  the real signal was its CEO's calm response to new 50% Bumiputera ownership
  rules for GLC/GLIC property disposals — a policy shift that could reshape
  large-ticket land deals. Meanwhile, three major listed developers reported
  FY2025 results on the same day: SimeProp posted record RM803M PBT, S P Setia
  beat its RM4.8B sales target, and IOI Properties saw profits surge 7x on
  Singapore asset gains. Campaign-wise, Tropicana wrapped up its CNY push and
  GUH opened doors in Penang — both offering real buyer incentives worth
  checking."

## Key Highlights

### For Buyers

* **New 50% Bumiputera ownership rule for GLC/GLIC property disposals (≥RM20M):** This is a policy shift. If you're a non-Bumiputera developer or investor eyeing government-linked land parcels, the buyer qualification bar just got higher.
* **Tropicana CNY campaign ended Feb 28** — if you registered interest before the deadline, follow up immediately. Rewards worth up to RM2.89M were on offer across 11 developments, with Breeze Hill at Genting Highlands (from RM348K) showing its first physical unit.
* **GUH's Taman Simpang Empat in Penang (from ~RM648K):** Freehold 2-storey terrace with 1,776 sqft — one of the more spacious landed options on Penang mainland at this price point. Worth a look if you're targeting the Simpang Ampat corridor.
* **S P Setia and SimeProp both setting FY2026 sales targets below FY2025 actuals** (Setia: RM4.6B vs RM5.11B achieved; SimeProp: RM4B vs RM4.2B achieved). This signals measured, not aggressive, pricing — buyers may have modest negotiation room in certain projects.

### For Investors

* **IOI Properties' RM741M Banting land sale to Bridge Data Centres** continues the data-centre land monetisation trend. IOI Industrial Park @ Banting was only launched Dec 2025 — selling 136 acres within weeks at premium industrial pricing is a strong demand signal for the data centre/industrial corridor.
* **IOI Properties REIT listing targeted for June 2026** — analysts (UOB Kay Hian, RHB) see this as a major catalyst. Injecting IOI City Mall and IOI Mall Puchong could unlock embedded value.
* **SimeProp's SHIFT32 strategy extends the planning horizon to 7 years** (from 5 under SHIFT25). Recurring income via data centres (20-year leases with hyperscalers) and malls now forms a visible long-term income stream.
* **EPF's 6.15% dividend and RM1.41 trillion AUM** — EPF continues to be the dominant institutional buyer in Malaysian property equities and REITs. Its 10% private-market allocation (real estate, infra, PE) means ~RM141B deployed in these assets.



## Brief Commentary

* **Demand by segment:** The three major developer results (SimeProp, S P Setia, IOI Properties) all point to strong industrial/data centre demand and steady residential absorption. Industrial products contributed 36% of SimeProp's sales and Setia Alaman Industrial Park debuted at 11% of S P Setia's development revenue — both confirming that industrial is no longer a niche segment. Residential landed remains the volume anchor, but high-rise is increasingly selective.
* **Data centre/industrial trend accelerating:** IOI Properties' RM741M Banting sale to Bridge Data Centres, SimeProp's dual hyperscale facilities at Elmina, and IOI's Iskandar Malaysia industrial park within the JS-SEZ all confirm that data centre-linked land transactions are now a mainstream revenue driver for Malaysian developers — not a one-off windfall.
* **Policy/regulatory tone:** The new 50% Bumiputera buyer requirement for GLC/GLIC property disposals above RM20M is the most significant regulatory development of the day. Combined with the existing 8% stamp duty on foreign residential purchases (up from 4%, introduced in Budget 2026), the regulatory stance is clearly tightening the rules on who can buy large assets — while simultaneously offering first-time buyer incentives (stamp duty exemptions extended to Dec 2027 for homes ≤RM500K).
* **Coverage bias note:** Saturday's news was dominated by KL/Selangor and Johor — reflecting where the FY results and major corporate actions sit. Penang appeared via GUH's CNY event and the LRT Mutiara Line public inspection (ongoing since Feb 24). Melaka got a mention via MTD Properties' CSR. East Malaysia had no significant property-specific reporting on this date.
