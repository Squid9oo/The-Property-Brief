summary: 2026 was an earnings avalanche — at least nine property developers
  filed full-year or quarterly results on Bursa, revealing record highs for Sime
  Darby Property and KSL, a sevenfold profit surge at IOI Properties, and
  decade-high sales at Mah Sing. Developer guidance for 2026 sales targets
  collectively points to cautious optimism, with JS-SEZ momentum,

  narratives.

## Key Highlights

* **Earnings avalanche:** At least nine property developers filed FY or quarterly results on a single day, making Feb 27 one of the busiest reporting days of the season. Sime Darby Property, KSL, and Mah Sing posted record or decade-high results.
* **Sime Darby Property** delivered its all-time highest PBT of RM803.4m and record sales of RM4.2b, beating its target by 17%. Industrial segment (36% of sales) has become the core growth engine.
* **IOI Properties** saw headline net profit surge 7x in 2Q to RM708.8m, but core underlying PBT growth of 87% is the more meaningful number. South Beach full consolidation and investment property revaluation lifted the topline significantly.
* **S P Setia** beat its RM4.8b sales target at RM5.11b, but full-year profit fell due to lower land transactions. Setia Alaman Industrial Park contributed 11% of dev revenue in its debut year — another proof point for the industrial pivot.
* **KSL Holdings** is the standout JS-SEZ play, with 2,023ha of landbank in the zone and a RM1.6b FY2026 sales target off the back of record RM526m profit.
* **Mah Sing** hit decade-high sales (RM2.51b) and is entering the high-end segment for the first time with a new brand at the Corus Hotel KL site.
* **IJM Land** launched Sutera Phase 2 (RM92.9m GDV, 104 units) at S2 Heights Aman, Seremban — steady landed product in a proven township.
* **Tropicana** remains in the red (FY2025 net loss RM118.8m) but the loss narrowed meaningfully from FY24, and management is pinning 2026 hopes on JS-SEZ demand uplift.

## Brief Commentary

* **Theme 1 — Industrial/data-centre land is now the sector's golden child.** Sime Darby Property (36% of sales from industrial), S P Setia (Setia Alaman Industrial Park debuting at 11% of dev revenue), IOI Properties (Banting land sale to Bridge Data Centres), Matrix Concepts (MVV City industrial land), and Mah Sing (Kulai JV with KLK Land) are all betting big on this segment. The demand-side story — data centres, logistics, NIMP 2030 — shows no signs of slowing.
* **Theme 2 — JS-SEZ is the most-cited growth catalyst across developers.** KSL (2,023ha in the zone), S P Setia (Southern region contributing RM900m in sales), UEM Sunrise (35% of sales from Iskandar), Tropicana (expecting improved Johor demand), and Sunway Property (Bukit Chagar RTS TOD) all explicitly named the Johor–Singapore corridor as central to their 2026 strategy. The RTS Link completion in Dec 2026 is the hard catalyst everyone is building toward.
* **Theme 3 — Cautiously optimistic guidance for 2026.** Most developers set FY2026 sales targets at or modestly below their FY2025 actuals (e.g., SDP RM4b vs RM4.2b actual; SP Setia RM4.6b vs RM5.11b actual). This suggests management teams are factoring in cost pressures (transport, imported materials), geopolitical uncertainty, and the possibility of macro slowdown — but not a demand collapse.
* **Theme 4 — Revenue quality under the microscope.** IOI Properties' headline 7x profit surge and Tropicana's prior-year RM211.9m one-off gain remind investors to strip out fair value gains, revaluation surpluses, and land disposal windfalls when assessing recurring earnings power. The gap between reported and underlying profit is widening across the sector.
