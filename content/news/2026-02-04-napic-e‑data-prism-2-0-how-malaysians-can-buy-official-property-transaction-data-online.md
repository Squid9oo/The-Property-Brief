summary: NAPIC (under JPPH) now offers e‑Data via PRISM 2.0, letting the public
  request/purchase unpublished property datasets (subject to availability and
  confidentiality) with online payment via DuitNow. This is a big step for
  transparency and faster market research especially for buyers, agents,
  valuers, researchers, and developers tracking actual transaction evidence.

NAPIC’s e‑Data service (via PRISM 2.0) is positioned as a way to obtain **unpublished data** that may not be available in standard publications, subject to availability and confidentiality rules. Users are directed to log in/register, then select JPPH data products through the platform, with payments made online via DuitNow (EFT).​

One key practical detail: **Property Transaction Data for the previous month is only available for purchase starting the 15th of the following month** (so it’s not “real-time,” but it is structured and scheduled). For users who complete purchases, the PRISM 2.0 e‑Data user manual also explains the end-to-end flow selecting products, checking out, paying, and downloading purchased files; it notes that downloads are time-limited (e.g., available within 14 days after successful payment in the module flow).​

If you want a quick starting point, begin with the official e‑Data page below, then download the manual to understand what product types exist, who can buy what, and how searches/purchases are done inside PRISM 2.0.​
