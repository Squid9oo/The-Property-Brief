summary: Sime Darby Property's quiet pivot from township builder to hyperscale
  data centre landlord is reshaping how the market values the stock, just as
  Kerjaya Prospek lands a RM502m reclamation contract for E&O's Penang island
  expansion. Meanwhile, IOI Properties' CEO has spent over RM100m buying his own
  shares ahead of dual REIT listings, and the RM1.6 billion Genting inheritance
  saga hits the High Court. A busy Monday that signals data centres, recurring
  income plays, and corporate restructurings remain the dominant themes heading
  into results season.

## Key Highlights

* **Sime Darby Property's data centre push** is the most strategically significant story — it represents a fundamental earnings profile shift from cyclical residential sales to contracted, recurring lease income spanning decades.
* **IOI Properties' dual REIT exercise** (combined estimated value up to RM15 billion) could be the biggest capital markets event in the property sector this year. The CEO's RM100m personal buying is a powerful insider confidence signal.
* **Kerjaya Prospek's RM502m STP2 contract** confirms E&O is pressing ahead with the Penang reclamation — a long-awaited milestone for the island's supply pipeline.
* **The Sunway-IJM takeover** remains alive but complicated by the MACC investigation. EPF's dual accumulation strategy suggests institutional confidence in the deal completing, but the corruption probe introduces tail risk.
* **LRT3's June 2026 target** is the most impactful near-term infrastructure catalyst for western Klang Valley property prices. Developers along the alignment should see renewed marketing momentum once an opening date is confirmed.
* **The Genting heiress estate trial** involves significant property assets in Penang and KL and could set important precedent for estate planning in Malaysia's high-net-worth developer families.

## Brief Commentary

* **Data centres and recurring income are reshaping developer valuations.** SimeProp, IOI Properties (via REITs), and SP Setia (REIT pipeline) are all moving toward asset-light, recurring-income models. The market is rewarding — or will reward — developers who can demonstrate contracted cash flows beyond the traditional sell-and-build cycle.
* **Results season is the next major catalyst.** With developers expected to report FY2025 results and reveal 2026 sales targets over the next two to four weeks, the sector is in a watch-and-wait mode. MBSB Research maintains a Positive call on the sector, expecting marginal new sales growth and stable demand supported by the Johor RTS, JS-SEZ, and data centre-related industrial demand.
* **Corporate M&A activity is at a multi-year high.** Between the Sunway-IJM takeover, IOI Properties' dual REIT listings, and SP Setia's own REIT preparations, the property sector is seeing more corporate restructuring activity than at any point since the 2015–2017 cycle. This is creating both opportunities and uncertainty — watch for the MACC probe impact on the Sunway-IJM timeline.
* **Policy and infrastructure tone remains supportive.** The LRT3 confirmation, Penang's quit rent revision (effective Jan 1, 2026, with rebate cushions), and Bursa's investor classification upgrade all point to a government that is actively enabling property market transparency and connectivity — even if execution on rail projects continues to lag original timelines.
