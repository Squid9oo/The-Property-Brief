## Key Highlights

* **Kerjaya Prospek's RM502m contract** is a significant order-book booster and confirms E&O's continued commitment to Penang's Seri Tanjung Pinang reclamation — one of the largest seafront developments in the state.
* **IOI Properties CEO's RM100m+ personal share purchases** during a closed period — combined with dual REIT plans worth up to RM15 billion — represent one of the strongest insider-conviction signals in the sector this year.
* **The Auditor-General's tabling of PPHM's financial unviability** is a formal confirmation that LTAT's property arm has been wound down, with liabilities exceeding assets by over RM20 million.
* **Battersea Power Station's final-phase masterplan activation** shows that Malaysia's biggest international property bet (S P Setia, Sime Darby Property, EPF, PNB) is entering its second half — still a decade or more of development ahead.
* **Local retail investors were net buyers of property stocks** at RM56.8 million for the week, bucking the broader institutional selling trend.



## Brief Commentary

* **Data-centre/industrial pivot is now the dominant growth theme.** IOI Properties' Banting land sale (RM741m to Bridge Data Centres) and the sector outlook feature both point to industrial/logistics as the primary demand driver going into 2026. Developers positioned in Johor, Selangor, and Negeri Sembilan industrial corridors are best placed to capture this wave.
* **REIT activity is accelerating as a capital recycling strategy.** IOI Properties' dual listing plan is the most ambitious, but the broader trend of developers seeking recurring income (EcoWorld's data-centre leases, CLMT's industrial acquisitions) signals a structural industry shift away from pure develop-and-sell models.
* **Financing conditions remain supportive but approval rates are tightening.** December 2025 saw property loan approval ratios dip to 42.7% (vs 50.2% in Dec 2024), even as applications rose. This means more people want to buy, but banks are pickier — a trend worth watching if it persists into 2026.
* **Construction pipeline is healthy, legal disputes are routine.** Kerjaya's RM4.4bn order book and Selangor Dredging's litigation update both represent normal operating conditions. The sector's earnings reporting season in late Feb/March 2026 will be the next major data point for developer performance.
