summary: Sunway Property leads the day with an ambitious RM4.4 billion sales
  target for 2026 off the back of record FY2025 results, while UOA Development's
  quarterly profit jumps 50% on revaluation gains. The PM's parliamentary
  confirmation that non-AI data centre approvals have been frozen for nearly two
  years has direct implications for property developers pivoting into the
  digital infrastructure space — a signal worth watching for Sime Darby
  Property, Sunway, and others with DC ambitions.

## Key Highlights

* **Sunway Property's RM4.4B target** signals continued confidence from one of Malaysia's top developers. The jump from RM4.0B actual in FY2025 and the RM5.1B launch pipeline — anchored by Johor RTS TOD, KV high-rises, and Penang mixed-use — makes this the most aggressive sales target in the group's history. International buyer share tripling from 6% to 15% in two years is a standout data point.
* **UOA Development's 4Q profit surge** was almost entirely driven by a massive RM169.2M revaluation surplus on investment properties, not operational performance — revenue actually fell 25.6%. Worth watching whether underlying billings recover in coming quarters.
* **Sunway Construction's record FY2025** — core earnings more than doubled, revenue up 51.6% to RM5.34B — is a direct proxy for the data centre construction boom. The RM17.5B tender pipeline (including 8 DC jobs >700MW) highlights how much runway remains for DC-linked contractors.
* **PM confirms non-AI DC freeze** — this is the clearest policy signal yet on data centre selectivity. Developers and landowners positioning land for generic co-location or cloud storage (non-AI) should take note: only AI-linked DCs are getting green lights. This favours established players like Sime Darby Property (Google/Pearl Computing) and penalises speculative DC land plays.
* **Roads-on-government-land ruling** — while not a headline-grabber, the deputy minister's statement clarifying that public roads cannot be privatised has implications for developers negotiating access roads and infrastructure handover in large townships. It reinforces existing law but signals the government's posture against asset transfers that could restrict public access.
* **Sheikh Muszaphar villa lawsuit** — a strata-adjacent case involving a high-profile defendant in Bukit Kiara. The legal claim centres on the Strata Management Regulations' obligations for shared party walls in joint villas. Outcome pending; case management on March 9.



## Brief Commentary

* **Demand signals remain firmly positive.** Sunway Property's record sales and aggressive 2026 targets, combined with UOA's RM672.9M in new property sales and strong unbilled backlogs across multiple developers, confirm that residential and mixed-use demand is holding up well into 2026. The big question is whether this momentum sustains beyond H1 given high base effects from 2025.
* **Data centres are now the defining sector theme.** Between Sunway Construction's record earnings driven by DC projects, Sime Darby Property's "AI landlord" pivot, and the PM's parliamentary confirmation that non-AI DCs are frozen, the message is clear: the data centre boom is real but increasingly selective. Developers with existing hyperscaler relationships (Google, Microsoft, etc.) are in the driver's seat. Speculative DC land banking without anchor tenants is getting riskier.
* **Policy tone is stable but watchful.** The government's posture — extending first-time buyer stamp duty relief through 2027, doubling foreign buyer stamp duty to 8%, and now restricting non-AI DCs — points to a calibrated approach: support domestic demand, cool foreign speculation, and channel infrastructure investment toward national AI priorities. No surprises, but developers should be planning around these rails.
* **Emerging marketing/sales tactics:** Sunway Property's focus on digital engagement (93% of web traffic from key local/international markets, Singapore traffic up 40%) and growing international buyer share suggests that cross-border digital marketing is becoming a core competency, not a side experiment. Developers lagging on this front — especially those with Johor exposure — are leaving money on the table as the JS-SEZ and RTS narratives draw Singaporean and regional interest.
