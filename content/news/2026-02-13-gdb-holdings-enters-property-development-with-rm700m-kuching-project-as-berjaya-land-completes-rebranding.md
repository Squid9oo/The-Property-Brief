## GDB Makes Bold Property Bet in Sarawak

GDB Holdings is stepping out of its construction comfort zone. The listed builder announced it's acquiring three leasehold land parcels in Kuching—21,926 square metres in total—for RM32.72 million cash, with plans for a mixed development worth an estimated RM700 million in gross development value.

The sites, purchased from Mighty Metaverse, Borneo 1 Stop Business Services, and Sport Pavillion, will host serviced apartments, small-office-home-office units, and retail space across multiple phases. It's GDB's first property development venture as a principal developer, marking a strategic shift for a company that's built its reputation building for others. Funding will come from internal cash and bank borrowings, with land acquisition expected to wrap within nine months.

## RM102 Million Court Win Over 8 Conlay Mess

On the same day, GDB's subsidiary Grand Dynamic Builders won a High Court judgment of RM102.08 million against KSK Land over unpaid works on the 8 Conlay mixed development in Kuala Lumpur. The award includes 5% annual interest on RM93.39 million plus RM80,000 in costs. [edgeprop](https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1915302/high-court-orders-ksk-land-pay-rm102m-gdb-unit-over-8-conlay-works)

The dispute stems from a RM1.25 billion main contractor agreement that unraveled when payments dried up in 2022. GDB suspended works, resumed after partial payment, then faced contract termination in 2023. KSK Land is now in liquidation and has filed for a scheme of arrangement, so whether GDB actually collects remains an open question.

## Berjaya Land Is Now Berjaya Property

Berjaya Land Bhd shareholders approved the company's name change to **Berjaya Property Bhd** at an extraordinary general meeting on February 13. Group CEO Syed Ali Shahul Hameed said the rebrand reflects property as the "cornerstone of value creation strategy," emphasizing long-life assets, recurring income, and disciplined asset management. [edgeprop](https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1915309/berjaya-land-be-renamed-berjaya-property)

It's more than cosmetic—the new name signals a clearer corporate identity as the group positions property front and center, potentially laying groundwork for future REIT structuring or asset monetization plays.

## UEM Sunrise Taps RM500M in Long-Tenor Sukuk

UEM Sunrise completed a RM500 million Islamic medium-term note issuance with a 12-year tenure maturing February 12, 2038. The notes sit under the company's existing RM4 billion IMTN program and follow murabahah via tawarruq principles.

Proceeds will fund shariah-compliant general corporate purposes including landbank acquisition, project development, infrastructure costs, and refinancing. The long tenor gives UEM Sunrise breathing room to execute its pipeline without near-term refinancing pressure.

## Property Loan Growth Slowing but Steady

MBSB Investment Bank's latest sector report shows December 2025 property loan applications rose 6.9% year-on-year to RM50.3 billion—the fifth consecutive month of growth—but cumulative 2025 growth was only 3.4% versus 4.9% in 2024.

MBSB IB revised its IOI Properties target price to RM2.97 from RM2.30 on narrower RNAV discount following the Banting land disposal.

Maybank Investment Bank struck a more cautious tone, maintaining a **NEUTRAL** rating and noting that after roadshows to 13 funds, investor focus has shifted to execution of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and corporate exercises like IOI's REIT listing.

## Federal Court Clears Taman Desa Condo to Proceed

The Federal Court dismissed landowner Ong Hock Te's application for leave to appeal, ending his legal challenge against Kaisar Maxim Sdn Bhd's 1,048-unit apartment project (RM600,000–RM1 million) in Taman Desa, Kuala Lumpur. Chief Justice Wan Ahmad Farid ruled Ong's seven legal questions failed the threshold under section 96 of the Courts of Judicature Act. [freemalaysiatoday](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2026/02/10/landowners-legal-battle-to-stop-condo-project-ends)

Ong was ordered to pay RM50,000 in costs. The Court of Appeal had already ruled in August 2025 that the High Court had no power to stay a development order issued by the KL Mayor. The developer can now proceed without further legal obstacles. [freemalaysiatoday](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2026/02/10/landowners-legal-battle-to-stop-condo-project-ends)
