summary: Malaysia’s 2025 property transaction value hit a decade-high, even as
  unsold completed units swelled past RM17.7b, underscoring a mounting overhang
  risk. At the same time, heavyweights like Sime Darby Property, Sunway, E&O and
  UOA reported strong results and ambitious 2026 sales targets, highlighting a
  clear divergence between large, well-capitalised players and the rest of the
  sector.

## Key Highlights

* **JPPH drops the full-year 2025 Property Market Report:** Total transaction value reached a decade-high of RM241.87b (+4.1% YoY), but transaction volume slipped 1% to 416,413 deals. The Malaysian House Price Index rose 2.6% to 233.1 points, with the average house price now at RM502,922. However, the unsold completed residential overhang surged past 30,000 units valued at RM17.73b — up over 30% from the previous quarter — a red flag that cannot be ignored.
* **Sime Darby Property posts its best-ever FY:** Record sales of RM4.2b and highest net profit (RM517.1m) underpin the group's SHIFT25 strategy delivery. Data centre leases at Elmina Business Park are becoming a meaningful recurring income anchor. FY26 sales target of RM4b and a RM4.7b GDV launch pipeline signal continued confidence.
* **E&O's luxury pivot pays off big-time:** 3Q net profit doubled YoY to RM63.5m, driven by strong billings from Andaman Island premium launches (RM900–1,000 psf) and landed projects in Elmina. The 50.5% gross margin is a standout in an industry where most developers are fighting cost pressures.
* **Sunway Property raises the bar again:** A RM4.2b sales target for 2026 with a RM4.8b pipeline — anchored by JS-SEZ/RTS-linked Johor launches (Bukit Chagar TOD, SCIP) and Klang Valley extensions. Foreign buyer share jumped from 6% in 2023 to 15% in 2025, a meaningful shift.
* **Radium Development pivots to healthcare real estate:** Beyond its core property pipeline (>RM4.9b GDV), the company is committing RM300m to a 140-bed hospital in Melaka — signalling a broader developer trend of seeking non-cyclical revenue streams.
* **LBS Bina's 4Q turnaround:** Net profit surged 243.4% YoY to RM40.6m on revenue of RM462.3m (+61% QoQ) — an aggressive quarter that likely reflects strong take-up from affordable housing launches.
* **UOA Development quietly delivering:** FY25 PAT jumped 65% to RM474m on revenue of RM674.3m. Bamboo Hills Residences and Duo Tower are doing the heavy lifting. DPS of 10 sen makes it one of the more generous dividend payers in the sector.

## Brief Commentary

* **Results season confirms the tale of two markets.** The big, well-capitalised developers (Sime Darby Property, Sunway, E&O, UOA) posted record or near-record numbers. Smaller or more leveraged names like WCT (-82.6% YoY net profit) and Avaland (-40.7% YoY) paint a less rosy picture. Scale, landbank quality, and product-market fit are widening the gap. Investors should watch for this divergence to intensify in 2026.
* **The overhang is the elephant in the room.** JPPH's full-year 2025 report confirms unsold completed residential units broke through 30,000 for the first time, valued at nearly RM18b. New launches also dropped 14.9% to ~64,500 units as developers pulled back. This is a healthy self-correction — developers are not flooding the market recklessly — but the secondary overhang (condos, serviced apartments in Johor, Perak, KL) remains a structural drag on pricing in non-prime locations.
* **Data centres and industrial: the new growth narrative.** Sime Darby Property's Elmina hyperscale leases, Sunway's Equalbase 103° free commercial zone in Johor, and Radium's healthcare diversification all point to the same theme: developers are actively building recurring income streams and positioning around the data centre/industrial ecosystem. This is no longer a side story — it is becoming the headline strategy for GLC-linked and large private developers.
* **Foreign buyer momentum is real but concentrated.** Sunway's foreign buyer share jumping from 6% to 15% in two years is notable. JS-SEZ, RTS Link completion (Dec 2026), and the Forest City Financial Zone are creating genuine cross-border demand in Johor. But this is overwhelmingly a Johor/Penang story — developers outside these corridors are not seeing the same uplift. Government policy stability (MM2H, stamp duty exemptions) will be critical to sustaining this trend into 2027.
