##### Land & General Bhd: Industrial park plan alongside residential pipeline

Land & General Bhd said it is entering industrial property development, with the first phase of a planned Selangor industrial park estimated at close to RM1 billion. The group said about 2,500 acres in Sungai Jernih, Selangor is in the final stages of being rezoned for industrial use, with an initial phase of 238 acres.
​
For phase one, the company indicated GDV of RM800 million to RM1 billion and said it plans to sell detached factories priced at RM10 million to RM20 million. It also said FY2026 residential launches are planned with total GDV of more than RM700 million, including a 1,008-unit serviced apartment project in Bandar Sri Damansara (GDV RM651 million) and the final phase of Sena Parc in Senawang.
​
Commentary: The industrial plan is a potential re-rating catalyst if approvals and execution timelines firm up, because it shifts the business mix beyond residential cycles. Key watch items are rezoning progress, take-up assumptions, and how quickly phase one converts into booked sales.

##### Radium Development Bhd: RM45m Bandar Ampang acquisition completed

Radium Development Bhd announced the completion of its acquisition of a leasehold parcel in Bandar Ampang, Ulu Langat, Selangor for a total purchase consideration of RM45,000,888.00. The company said the sale and purchase agreement became unconditional on 23 July 2025, the completion period was extended to 31 December 2025 and then to 31 January 2026 (without interest or penalty), and vacant possession was delivered on 31 January 2026.
​
Radium said the balance purchase price of RM31,500,621.60 was paid in full on 13 February 2026, completing the transaction, and the announcement is dated 19 February 2026.
​
Commentary: Completion reduces execution risk on the landbank side and allows investors to focus on the next milestones (planning approvals, product mix, launch timing), which are not specified in sources. Any delay or cost pressure now becomes more visible because the land deal is no longer “pending”.

##### Seal Incorporated Bhd: Broker note claims control shift at Penang reclamation project (unconfirmed)

A TA Research daily market commentary carried on i3investor claims Seal Incorporated Bhd is relinquishing control over its 31.5-acre reclamation project in Penang to a unit of GSD Land. Deal structure, consideration, approvals, timelines, and whether there is (or will be) a formal company statement are not specified in sources.
​
Commentary: If confirmed, a change in control can alter funding responsibilities, development rights, and the project’s timeline, which can be material for valuation. The next thing to watch is whether Seal issues a Bursa filing or formal clarification addressing the claim.
