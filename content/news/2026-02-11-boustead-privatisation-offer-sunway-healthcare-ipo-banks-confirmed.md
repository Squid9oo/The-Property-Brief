## Boustead Heavy Industries(BHIC) privatisation: premium on the table

BHIC said it received a proposal offering **RM0.48 cash per share** via a selective capital reduction and repayment exercise, valued at about **RM149.6 million**. The proposal includes cancelling shares (and certain RCPS classes) not held by Boustead Holdings, which would make BHIC a wholly owned subsidiary once completed. Boustead Holdings also stated it does not intend to maintain BHIC’s listing status on Bursa Malaysia’s Main Market, with an acceptance deadline of **5.00pm on 3 March 2026**. 

Boustead described the 48 sen as a premium ranging from **54.84% to 96.08%** over various price/VWAP reference points.

## Sunway Healthcare IPO: underwriting locked in

Sunway Healthcare Holdings signed an underwriting agreement with **six investment banks** for its planned Main Market IPO. The IPO is stated to comprise up to **1.969 billion shares**, including **1.39 billion existing shares** and **575 million new shares**, with a prospectus expected in **Q1 2026**. Sunway said IPO proceeds are intended mainly for capex to expand existing hospitals, and the group reported total licensed bed capacity of **1,805** as of January 2026.

**Why property folks should care:** when a healthcare platform gears up for capital markets, expansion timelines get real — and that can change demand patterns around hospital catchments (commercial, residential rentals, staff housing) faster than people expect.
