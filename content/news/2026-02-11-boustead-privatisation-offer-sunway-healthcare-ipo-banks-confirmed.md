## Federal Court: development order dispute ends

The Federal Court (led by Chief Justice Wan Ahmad Farid) refused leave to appeal in the dispute involving Ong Hock Te and Kaisar Maxim. \[code:0] Ong was ordered to pay RM50,000 in costs, and the outcome clears the path for the 1,048-unit apartment project, with indicative pricing stated at RM600,000 to RM1 million per unit.

**Key precedent for planning risk**
The ruling confirms that the High Court has no jurisdiction to stay a development order issued by the Kuala Lumpur Datuk Bandar. \[code:0] For approved projects, this reduces a specific legal “stop-work” risk once a development order is in place.

## Boustead: proposed BHIC privatisation at RM0.48/share

Boustead Holdings Bhd (stated as a 72.38% owner) has proposed to privatise BHIC via a selective capital reduction. \[code:0] The proposed price is RM0.48 per share, implying an estimated deal value of about RM149.6 million, and is described as a 54.8% to 96.1% premium to recent trading prices.

A stated deadline for a board decision is 3 March 2026.

## Berjaya Land: Jesselton Courtyard sales gallery opens

Berjaya Land Bhd has opened the sales gallery for Jesselton Courtyard at Jesselton Selatan, George Town. \[code:0] The project is described as 239 freehold units on 11.9 acres, with built-ups ranging from 2,734 to 6,649 sq ft, positioned as a low-density, landed-style gated community with completion targeted for end-2027.

A roadshow is scheduled at Gurney Plaza from 14 February to 1 March.
