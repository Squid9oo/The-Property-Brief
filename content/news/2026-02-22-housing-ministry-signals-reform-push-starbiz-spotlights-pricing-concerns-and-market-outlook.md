## Key Highlights

* **Housing Ministry's reform narrative remains front-and-centre.** The RM123.7m RIBI allocation signals continued KPKT community engagement, while StarBiz7's Sunday analysis pieces keep the zero-abandonment-by-2030 target and Madani Housing Reforms in the public spotlight. The reforms — including e-SPA, HIMS digital platform, TEDUH data bank, and mandatory HDA audits — took effect from 1 Jan 2026.
* **Pricing abuse commentary is a notable editorial signal.** Datuk Mani Usilappan's piece on systemic price engineering in housing is the kind of commentary that typically precedes regulatory tightening or public consultation. Worth watching for any follow-up policy response from KPKT or Bank Negara.
* **Penang LRT Mutiara Line public inspection is a tangible infrastructure milestone.** The 6km cross-sea link between KOMTAR and Penang Sentral is now entering the public feedback phase (24 Feb – 24 May 2026). Properties along the alignment and near station locations in Bayan Lepas, George Town, and Seberang Perai should see renewed interest. Operations target: Dec 2031.
* **Market outlook data is encouraging but measured.** MBSB Research highlights property loan applications growing for five consecutive months through Dec 2025, while Savills points to industrial and logistics as the lead sector. Developers are expected to set marginally higher sales targets for 2026, with results reporting season this month providing clearer visibility.
* **No major land deals, new launches, or M&A transactions were announced on 22 Feb 2026.** This is consistent with a Sunday news cycle. The market's transactional pulse is expected to resume on Monday, 23 Feb.

## Brief Commentary

* **Sunday = feature-heavy, deal-light.** No significant corporate or transactional property news broke on 22 Feb 2026. The action was in the opinion pages and market analysis, which is typical for a weekend. Developers are in results-reporting mode for FY2025, so expect a flurry of earnings, sales targets, and launch pipeline announcements through late Feb and early March.
* **The "pricing abuse" narrative is worth tracking.** When mainstream media runs front-page commentary questioning whether house prices reflect genuine value or are being artificially engineered, it typically triggers a response — either from regulators or from developers repositioning their messaging. Combined with the zero-abandonment reforms and HDA audit enforcement, the regulatory tone heading into 2026 is clearly buyer-protection-first.
* **Penang LRT is the week's infrastructure story.** The public inspection milestone gives concrete shape to Penang's rail connectivity ambitions. For developers with landbank along the alignment — particularly around Bayan Lepas, KOMTAR, and Penang Sentral — this is a pricing-support event. The 8-minute cross-sea connection effectively redraws the commuting map for the island-mainland divide.
* **Industrial and data-centre demand remains the sector's growth engine.** The StarBiz7 market outlook piece reinforced what Henry Butcher, Knight Frank, and Savills have all been saying: industrial and logistics properties are the crown jewel of 2026. Approved investments of RM285.2bil in 9M2025 (+13.2% YoY), led by Johor (RM91.1bil), continue to underwrite demand for industrial land across the country.
