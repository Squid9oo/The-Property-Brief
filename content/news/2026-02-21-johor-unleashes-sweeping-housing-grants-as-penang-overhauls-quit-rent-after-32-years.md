## Johor Rolls Out Extensive Grants to Anchor 100,000-Unit Housing Target

Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi confirmed the state's blueprint to build 100,000 Rumah Mampu Milik Johor (RMMJ) units by 2030, managed by the Perbadanan Kemajuan Perumahan Negeri Johor (PKPJ). The timeline targets 30,000 completions by the end of 2026, building on the 20,000 units finished between 2022 and 2025. To ensure these homes find buyers, the state formalized the Perumahan Kasih Johor (PKJ) 2026 assistance framework. This includes a RM5,000 grant for 20,000 first-time buyers to absorb legal fees, stamp duties, and loan costs. The state also expanded its RM2,000 move-in assistance to include the M40 demographic purchasing properties priced at RM500,000 or below, and introduced a subsidy of up to RM30,000 for residents building homes on their own land.

By absorbing the upfront friction costs that routinely price the B40 and lower M40 out of the market, Johor is effectively underwriting a guaranteed demand floor for developers operating in the affordable and mass-market segments.

## Penang Executes First Quit Rent Restructuring Since 1994

The Penang state government will enforce a revised quit rent structure starting January 1, 2026, alongside the gazettement of 25 new townships. The Chief Minister noted the update corrects a 30-year pricing lag and outdated urban classifications dating back to 1966. The financial impact is stark for reclassified plots: a 1.6-hectare parcel upgraded from agricultural to commercial use will see its annual tax jump from RM48 to RM44,900. To soften the blow, the state will implement an automatic 50% rebate.

While the 50% rebate prevents an immediate cash flow shock, developers and land bankers holding long-term unutilized commercial land in newly urbanized zones will need to recalibrate their holding costs and project feasibility margins.

## KPKT Prepares Second Attempt at Urban Renewal Bill

Housing and Local Government (KPKT) Minister Nga Kor Ming announced the ministry is prepared to re-table the Urban Renewal Bill 2025 for its second reading, pending Cabinet approval. The initial reading in August 2025 was delayed following pushback from members of parliament. The proposed legislation focuses on creating a systematic process for redeveloping dilapidated and structurally unsafe urban buildings.

Passing this bill will provide the legal mechanism required to unlock high-value, stranded land in mature city centers by streamlining the often-paralyzed strata consensus process.
