### IOI Properties: monetising land while riding the data-centre wave

IOI Properties’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortune Growers Sdn Bhd, has signed a deal to dispose of about 50 hectares (136 acres) of industrial land at IOI Industrial Park @ Banting to Bridge Data Centres Malaysia VII/VIII Sdn Bhd for RM740.68 million. The land sits within a 322‑acre industrial park positioned near major highways, Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Port Klang, a location that directly addresses data-centre needs for power, connectivity and logistics.

Management highlighted that Bridge Data Centres is expanding its data-centre business model on the site, effectively turning IOI’s industrial park into a regional hub for digital infrastructure underpinned by the New Industrial Master Plan (NIMP) 2030. Analysts note that the transaction may allow IOI Properties to book substantial one-off income while still retaining sizeable remaining land in the park for future phases, balancing capital recycling with long-term industrial development.

For investors, this deal reinforces three important points: industrial land pricing is firm where infrastructure is ready; hyperscaler/data-centre demand is real, not theoretical; and large developers with planning scale and utilities-ready landbanks will be the preferred partners for global operators.

### Binastra: from general contractor to data-centre specialist

Binastra Corp Bhd’s latest win confirms that data centres are no longer a niche sideline for the group. Its wholly-owned unit, Binastra Builders Sdn Bhd, has accepted a RM503 million contract from Exsim Sri Permai Sdn Bhd for the development of a data centre in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, covering design, construction and infrastructure works. The contract will commence on 19 February 2026 with a 20‑month completion period, effectively providing two financial years of earnings visibility.

Management pointed out that Binastra already has an established presence in data-centre projects in Bukit Jalil and Cyberjaya, and is actively exploring further opportunities. Recent contracts in this space have pushed its outstanding order book to record levels, with a sizeable proportion now linked to higher-spec, tech-related assets instead of vanilla residential or commercial buildings.

This shift matters because data-centre contracts tend to be larger-ticket, specification-heavy and margin-supportive, especially for contractors that can handle design-and-build scopes and M&E-intensive work. For Binastra, the Cheras job is another step in positioning itself as a go-to contractor for the digital infrastructure build-out that Malaysia is courting.

### Sunway–IJM: building a national “champion”

In the background of these project-level announcements sits a potential sector re-rating story: Sunway’s proposed RM11 billion takeover of IJM Corp. The cash-and-shares offer of RM3.15 per IJM share implies a premium over the pre-announcement price and, if successful, would create one of the country’s largest integrated property and construction groups spanning townships, infrastructure, industrial and urban regeneration assets.

Sunway has said it expects completion by the third quarter of 2026, subject to receiving more than 50% acceptance and obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals. If it breaches the 90% ownership threshold, the group may move to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares and delist IJM from Bursa Malaysia.

For the broader sector, a successful merger could trigger a “size matters” mindset, where scale, balance sheet strength and integrated capabilities become key differentiators in winning large industrial, infrastructure and transit-linked projects. Smaller players may need to either specialise (for example, in data centres, logistics parks or niche resi) or consider strategic tie-ups to stay relevant.

### AME REIT: steady REIT earnings from industrial assets

On the income side of the market, AME Real Estate Investment Trust (AME REIT) reported a solid third quarter for its financial year 2026. Net profit rose to around RM9.5–9.6 million, supported by a 23% increase in net property income to about RM14.4 million, driven by contributions from newly acquired properties and positive rental reversions. The REIT also maintained a 100% committed occupancy rate across its portfolio, underscoring strong demand for its industrial assets.

A distribution per unit (DPU) of roughly 2.06 sen was declared for the quarter, keeping the REIT on track as a yield play backed by high-utilisation industrial properties. For income-focused investors, AME REIT offers a way to participate in the same industrial and manufacturing growth theme without taking on development or construction risk.

### Haily Group: Johor landed housing still in demand

While data centres and industrial deals grab headlines, Johor’s landed housing market continues to generate real contract flows for mid-sized builders like Haily Group Bhd. The group has secured a RM48.2 million construction contract in Johor Bahru from Gunung Impian Development Sdn Bhd to build 113 units of double-storey terrace houses in Taman Impian Emas.

The job, which runs for 19 months, adds to Haily’s existing order book in Johor and reinforces the narrative that demand for well-located landed homes remains resilient, especially in matured townships with existing amenities. With the Johor–Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) and RTS Link as structural catalysts, contractors with a strong local track record are likely to see a steady pipeline of residential and mixed-use work around key growth corridors.

### What these moves say about Malaysia’s property cycle

Viewed together, these developments sketch an important picture for anyone tracking Malaysia’s property market direction into 2026.

First, industrial and data-centre assets are clearly moving from “future theme” to “current earnings driver” as large developers like IOI monetise strategically located landbanks and contractors such as Binastra pivot towards higher-specification jobs. Second, scale and integration are being rewarded – Sunway’s bid for IJM shows that building a national “champion” with end‑to‑end capabilities is very much on the table.

Third, stable income vehicles like AME REIT and steady residential builders like Haily demonstrate that the industrial story doesn’t replace traditional housing demand; it layers on top of it. For investors, the emerging playbook for 2026 looks diversified: developers with strong industrial landbanks, contractors with proven data-centre expertise, REITs anchored by industrial properties, and selective exposure to Johor’s landed housing cycle all sit on the right side of the trend line.
