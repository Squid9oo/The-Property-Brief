##### **Penang opens RFP for Weld Quay waterfront**

Penang is inviting proposals for a mixed-use Weld Quay Waterfront Development on about 13.25 acres within George Town’s UNESCO buffer zone, in a tender led by Penang Development Corporation (PDC). Around 12.05 acres belong to the state and 1.2 acres to PDC, with the request for proposals closing at 12pm on 30 March 2026 and tender documents priced at RM5,000.
​
The site fronts the channel facing the mainland and links directly to the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway, with future connectivity expected from the planned Macallum LRT station that will connect to Penang Sentral. The project is positioned as a mixed-use scheme with housing and commercial components, and must respond sensitively to nearby heritage assets such as the clan jetties. Development in the area is constrained by heritage guidelines, including height controls (reported as an 18 m cap in related coverage).

Commentary:
This RFP is one of Penang’s most closely watched urban-waterfront opportunities, but heritage rules and height limits mean bidders will need to balance placemaking with realistic yields. Watch which consortia participate and how aggressively they underwrite density, given the constraints and the long lead time typical of complex waterfront regeneration.

##### Penang land tax: higher rates, but appeals channel available

Penang has confirmed that landowners can appeal recently revised land tax (quit rent) rates via their District and Land Offices, with special attention to those holding First Grade titles. The new structure, effective 2026, moves away from legacy agricultural-based assessments dating back to 1994 and taxes land based on actual use.
​
Under the revised schedule, industrial land is charged RM3.25 per square metre statewide, residential buildings RM0.70 per square metre in urban areas and RM0.50 in rural areas, while commercial properties face RM3.25 per square metre in urban areas and RM2.80 in rural areas. Out of 370,000 land titles, about 230,000 are First Grade, many of which had been paying low agricultural rates despite being used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes. The state is offering rebates of up to 50% in 2026 to ease the transition, and appeals can be escalated beyond district level for larger amounts.

Commentary:
For developers and land bankers, especially those holding old First Grade titles, this change lifts carrying costs and could push some to accelerate project timelines or divest non-core plots. The existence of rebates and an appeal process softens the immediate shock, but the direction of travel is clear: Penang is re-aligning land taxation with actual land use, which will matter in feasibility assumptions.

##### **PR1MA appoints Brian Iskandar as group CEO**

PR1MA Corporation Malaysia has named Brian Iskandar Zulkarim as its group CEO, effective 1 January 2026, succeeding Datuk Seri Mohd Nazri Md Shariff who had led the corporation since May 2020. Before this appointment, Brian Iskandar served as CEO of Bandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd, a Ministry of Finance–linked company, where he oversaw the advancement and master planning of the 196.27-hectare Bandar Malaysia development with an estimated GDV of RM173 billion.

PR1MA’s chairman described the move as part of a push for “strong, stable and performance‑focused leadership”, indicating expectations that the new CEO will build on ongoing reforms while adapting to current housing needs. Further details on any strategic shifts, pipeline targets or revised delivery timelines under his leadership were not specified in sources.

Commentary:
A CEO with large-scale master planning and GLC experience could signal more structured collaboration between PR1MA and other public or semi-public landowners. Investors and contractors should watch for indications of project prioritisation, delivery pace and any recalibration of PR1MA’s product mix under the new leadership.

##### **MM2H flows: property remains a key beneficiary**

Coverage of the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) programme shows it generated around RM3.87 billion in economic contributions in 2025, including both cash inflows and property investment. Nearly 750 residential property purchases were completed under MM2H, with an additional pipeline of about RM2.3 billion in potential property investments from over 2,600 prospective buyers. Chinese nationals comprise the largest share of approved participants and property buyers, followed by other Asian markets. Detailed breakdowns by state, price band or built form were not specified in sources.

Commentary:
The numbers confirm MM2H is not just a visa product but a meaningful driver of mid‑ to high‑end residential demand, especially in key gateway cities. Developers with products aligned to foreign retirees and long-stay occupants should track any further tweaks to MM2H rules, as regulatory shifts will directly influence this demand stream.

##### Johor to build new homes for Orang Asli fire victims

##### Melaka: cemetery land handover and “digital graves” pilot

In Melaka, a private developer handed over roughly 0.4 acres of cemetery land in Kampung Krubong to local mosque authorities, responding to concerns over burial space near expanding housing areas. The state also highlighted its Digital Graves initiative, under which more than 500 grave plots have been mapped and digitised as part of a cemetery management pilot. Links to nearby residential projects or specific developers beyond the mentioned firm were not specified in sources.
