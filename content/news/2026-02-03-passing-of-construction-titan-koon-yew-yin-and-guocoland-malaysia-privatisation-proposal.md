  share, potentially removing another property counter from Bursa Malaysia."

Prominent Malaysian businessman and engineer Koon Yew Yin passed away in Ipoh at the age of 93, as reported on February 2–3, 2026.  He was best known as the co‑founder of three major construction and infrastructure names on Bursa Malaysia - Gamuda, IJM Corp and Mudajaya which together helped shape much of the country’s modern highways, infrastructure and large‑scale projects.

Beyond construction, Koon was also widely followed in the investing community for his frank stock‑market commentaries and for his philanthropy, including sizeable donations to education causes and scholarships for underprivileged students.  His passing marks the end of an era for Malaysia’s first‑generation construction entrepreneurs, even as the companies he helped build continue to anchor the sector.

At the same time, the listed property space is seeing further consolidation. GuocoLand (Malaysia) Bhd’s major shareholder, GLL (Malaysia) Pte Ltd (part of the Guoco/Quek Leng Chan group), has proposed to privatise the company at RM1.10 per share via a selective capital reduction and capital repayment exercise.  The offer represents roughly a mid‑teens premium to the last traded price prior to the announcement, but still at a discount to the company’s reported net tangible assets per share.

If approved by disinterested shareholders and sanctioned by the court, the move will see GuocoLand Malaysia delisted and become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GuocoLand Ltd, effectively removing another property counter from Bursa Malaysia’s investable universe.  The rationale cited includes low trading liquidity and limited benefits from remaining listed, while offering minority shareholders an exit at a premium market price.

Taken together, these developments highlight a generational transition in Malaysia’s construction‑property ecosystem and a continuing trend of privatisations among asset‑rich but thinly traded counters.
