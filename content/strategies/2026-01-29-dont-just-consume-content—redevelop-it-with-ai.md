In our field, we come across useful videos, ideas, and insights almost every day.

Most people watch, nod, and move on. That's where the opportunity dies. When I find content relevant to sales, marketing, consumer psychology, or team development, I treat it as raw material—something I can reshape into practical value. And with AI, this process has never been easier or faster.

\### The input

I watched a solid video and instead of just saving it, I fed it into AI along with my intentions.

\### The workflow (real example)

I'm sharing my prompt screenshot (not because it's perfect) but to show how simple the workflow can be.

\### The result

Within minutes, AI turned that video into structured insights I can use for my team.

\### My takeaway

This isn't about replacing thinking. It's about training ourselves to think better and letting technology amplify that thinking.

Don't just consume content. Redevelop it. Adapt it. Extract value from it. The real skill today is turning information into output quickly.
