In our field, we come across useful videos, ideas, and insights almost every day. 

Most people watch… nod… and move on. That’s where the opportunity dies. Whenever I find content that’s relevant to sales, marketing, consumer psychology, or team development, I treat it as raw material, something I can reshape into practical value. And with AI, this process has never been easier or faster.

Recently, I watched a solid video[](https://lnkd.in/gT4K4Psz). Instead of just saving it, I fed it into AI along with my intentions. I’ve also included a screenshot of my exact prompt not because it’s perfect, but to show how simple the workflow can be.

Within minutes, AI turned that video into structured insights I can use for my team.

This isn’t about replacing thinking. It’s about training ourselves to think better and letting technology amplify that thinking.

Don’t just consume content. Redevelop it. Adapt it. Extract value from it. The real skill today is knowing how to turn information into output quickly. We finally have tools that can multiply our capabilities. The ones who learn to use them will move faster, create more impact, and stay ahead.

Sharing the video link here, along with my prompt screenshot, in case it inspires you to try the same process.
