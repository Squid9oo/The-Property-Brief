  I’m not a jargon person, but in property marketing I follow one rule: whatever
  we do must create real benefit for people.

  ​

  Instead of choosing between hard selling and random lifestyle posts, I use lifestyle content to earn attention while a consistent brand presence does the quiet selling—hyperlocal, repeatable, and built for long-term familiarity.

Everyone talks about awareness, branding, funnels, and campaigns but I’m not here to impress you with jargon.​ In property marketing, I follow one simple rule: whatever we do must create real **benefit** for people.​

On social media, I see two extremes: hard selling (“Buy now”, “Last unit”, “PM for price”) or random lifestyle content that’s fun but has no clear purpose for the project.​
I don’t want to choose between them I want content people enjoy that still quietly sells property.​

To me, marketing is not “push, push, push.”​
It’s helping people see real benefits in their daily life makan places, weekend activities, community, and convenience then naturally linking that lifestyle to the project.​

## My 4-step structure (vertical video)

1. Own the lifestyle of one town (example: if the project is in Puchong, the content focuses on Puchong).​
2. If it’s lifestyle content outside the property, keep a permanent thin brand banner on screen from start to end.​
3. Lead with the brand in the intro (brand-first), not the host’s name.​
4. Use the caption to connect the place to the project and invite viewers to the sales gallery (example: voucher redemption + gallery visit + data capture).​

Yes, some people will come for the voucher and never buy and I accept that risk.​ Because the content is hyperlocal, most people who respond will be from the same area, and over time that builds familiarity and a contact pool you can nurture.​ That’s the marketing I believe in: benefit people first, sales will follow.​

## Next steps (to refine + test fast)

* Write your “town ownership” promise in one line (e.g., “Matrix helps you live better in Puchong”) and pin it on your profile for 30 days.​
* Pilot 12 videos in 14 days: 8 lifestyle (with banner) + 4 property (no banner), then compare saves, shares, and profile visits.​
* Tighten the voucher mechanic: require simple opt-in (WhatsApp/form) and track show-up rate + appointment set rate, not just redemptions.​
* Create a repeatable caption template: “Place + distance/time to project + why it matters + gallery CTA.”​
