summary: How to leverage neighbourhood strengths when internal amenities aren't
  your strongest selling point.
---
Property marketers don't always have internal amenities that stand out as their strongest selling point. But what if we could "borrow" the strengths from the neighbourhood instead?



\### The Sunway Lagoon example

Consider properties near Sunway Lagoon. Instead of just highlighting proximity, why not run a digital campaign offering a free theme park day pass for lead generation? For actual buyers, give a truly unique reward: a 5-year annual pass to Sunway Lagoon, which means up to 1,825 days of free family fun, making lifestyle and experience part of the value proposition.



\### Why limit the campaign to 3 months?

To create urgency, this campaign would run for only 3 months. Why? Because effective marketing is about storytelling and stories need momentum and fresh twists to stay compelling. Extending a campaign indefinitely leads to audience fatigue, switching strategies every quarter keeps the message vibrant and prospects engaged.



\### The template for other locations

For those marketing properties outside Sunway, this strategy is just a template. Audit your local area for interesting lifestyle spots—whether it's a theme park, retail hub, cultural centre, or nature retreat—and craft an irresistible campaign that leverages those neighbourhood strengths.



\### Bottom line

Don't just sell units, sell gateways to experiences people desire.
