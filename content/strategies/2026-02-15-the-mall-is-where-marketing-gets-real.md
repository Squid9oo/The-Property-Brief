summary: If your marketing looks like your competitor’s marketing, you’re paying
  to be ignored. The fastest way to break that pattern is simple, stop
  benchmarking only within property, and start learning from retailers who fight
  for attention every day.

If your campaign looks like your competitor’s campaign, you’re not "playing safe", you’re paying to blend in. Property marketers love benchmarking within property, then wonder why buyers scroll past, walk past, and forget us.

There’s a reason “retail safaris” exist: they’re built on the idea that you learn faster by watching real marketing collide with real shoppers in a live environment. “Retail Safari” has even been described as bringing learners (students and executives) into retail settings to see first-hand how marketing knowledge plays out in the aisles and shelves.
​
And store walks have long been used by businesses to connect with consumers and watch plans “come to life” at the shelf, meaning, reality quickly exposes what works and what doesn’t.

Proof (things I’ve borrowed from malls into property)

**Booth designs:** I stopped comparing booths only within property. I started looking at telco, beauty, even snack brands, because those brands are obsessed with stopping foot traffic. When you borrow their thinking, your property booth suddenly has more punch, not just more information.

**Giant banner:** The day you see a massive banner hanging down a mall atrium, it hits you, vertical space is prime real estate too. I ran a Matrix giant banner at AEON Mall Nilai, and it wasn’t about “doing a banner.” It was about owning sightlines from far away, the same way a landmark owns a skyline.

**LED screens:** Walk a modern mall and you’ll notice how many outlets use motion, big screens, small screens, looping promos. Mall advertising itself often includes digital options alongside physical placements. Once you train your eye on that, you stop being “happy with any screen vendor” and start having taste: brightness, viewing distance, content rhythm, and how premium it feels.
​
**Decor and photo moments:** Malls don’t decorate because they’re bored. They decorate because it changes the mood, lifts footfall energy, and gives people a reason to take a photo and remember the place. That’s the same logic behind “instagrammable spots” at clubhouses and galleries, memory is a marketing asset.

**Product display** → scale model creativity: I once saw a retailer display products inside a hanging open-box concept. I used that as a reference for presenting a typical scale model, and other developer competitor asking for the vendor's contact so that they can do the same.

Thinking shifts (not steps)
​
Stop treating malls as “places with tenants,” and start seeing them as media ecosystems. You’ll notice formats everywhere, standees, wall wraps, elevator/escalator placements, big hanging banners, digital screens. Even if you don’t buy any of it, it rewires how you think about your own assets (sales gallery, hoarding, site fencing, commercial frontage).
​
Stop designing to look correct. Start designing to be noticed.

Mini case: empty unit → “something is coming”
I’ve seen malls cover empty or under-renovation units so the corridor never looks dead. I copied that idea for unsold commercial shop lots by wrapping the frontage (doors/windows). It made the row feel active and intentional, like there’s a next chapter without changing the bricks.

Cross-industry benchmarking matters because it exposes best practices and ideas you won’t see if you only look at your own sector. It also matches how customers form expectations: they compare experiences across touch points (retail, on-demand services, phone companies), then bring those expectations into everything else including property.

Marketing doesn’t die because budgets are small. It dies because thinking is small, trapped inside one industry’s habits.
