summary: >
  At my previous company, every campaign used to ship with a new microsite and
  new domain, effective short term, but expensive and it resets SEO once the
  project ends.


  We changed the model by building one master domain (matrixtogo.com) where campaigns and events could live, then expanded it into an always-on platform that gets stronger over time instead of restarting every launch.

During my time with Matrix Concepts, I noticed one thing about our marketing every time we ran a campaign or event, we ended up building a new microsite with a fresh domain. It worked, but it also meant more costs, and whatever SEO effort we put in basically disappeared once the project was sold out.  

I decided to change that. I asked the digital team to build one master site with a single domain where all campaigns and events could live. That’s how matrixtogo.com started.  From there, we expanded it into a property listing site. Instead of having SEO “restart” with every new project, we now have one platform that grows stronger over time. 

Microsites still make sense for short-term launches, but the main site is where the long-term value is.  In the end, this move helped us save costs, build a stronger online presence, and make SEO actually work for the company not just for a single campaign.  Sometimes it’s not about doing more, but making one smart move that compounds over time.
